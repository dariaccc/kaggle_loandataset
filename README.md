Task for AI course
Project description:

Build models to predict loan approval using the Kaggle Loan Approval Prediction Dataset.  

Tasks: 
  Preprocessing – Clean the data and engineer useful features, if needed.  
  Modeling – Train both a Logistic Regression and a Decision Tree classifier. Tune the model, if needed. 
  Evaluation – Compare models using metrics and visualizations.  
  Conclusion – Select the better model and justify your choice.  

Deliverables:
Submit a 1–2 page PDF report summarizing:
  Model performance  
  Key graphs  
  Your model choice and reasoning
